Using SimConnect to control the player is relatively simple. A mixture of getters, setters, Aircraft Events are enough to be able to log information from the player aircraft and control it.
Controlling an ai agent, however, is significantly more complicated. I was able to spawn the aircraft in, but after 40 seconds, it would stop midair. I am currently still trying to figure out the system completely, as the documentation for the python version of SimConnect is lackluster at best. However, as of now, the two main roadblocks are being able to find the object id, which should theoretically be required to control the aircraft. Multiple attempts were made to find the object id, such as a normal getter, or by subscribing to their event system, both to no avail. Another possibility to create ai aircraft is by running multiple instances of msfs, and controlling one aircraft in each.
We can create POIs to represent where flags are by using the MSFS dev mode, and importing the package
Logging is relatively easy as well, as it just involves passing variables through a quick script to log to a json
One last note is that everything for this project was completed in python. Theoretically, most of this project should be able to be completed in msfs using missions functionality, however there were some limitations, such as lack of scripting ability that led me to control everything through python.
